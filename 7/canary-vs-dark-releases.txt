--------------------------------------------Canary Release----------------------------------------------------------
Canary release is a form of deployment where you want to divert a percentage of traffic to new version
to test out the correctness before opening up to all users.

---------------------------------------------DARK Release---------------------------------------------------------
Dark release is when you want only specific users to be able to access the service.  

I have decided that all user requests which carry extra header - “ x-my-header” with value as dark, would go to newly deployed risky pod. 
Rest other requests, which do not carry this header, would continue on safe existing pods
