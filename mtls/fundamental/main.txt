--------------------------------Mutual TLS Migration--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Istio automatically configures workload sidecars to use mutual TLS when calling other workloads. 

By default, Istio configures the destination workloads using PERMISSIVE mode. 

When PERMISSIVE mode is enabled, a service can accept both plaintext and mutual TLS traffic. 

In order to only allow mutual TLS traffic, the configuration needs to be changed to STRICT mode.

You can use the Grafana dashboard to check which workloads are still sending plaintext traffic to the workloads in PERMISSIVE mode 
and choose to lock them down once the migration is done.
