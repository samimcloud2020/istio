-------------------------------------Load balancing options------------------------------------------------------------
By default, Istio uses a least requests load balancing policy, where requests are distributed among the instances with the least number of requests.
Istio also supports the following models, which you can specify in destination rules for requests to a particular service or service subset.

Random: Requests are forwarded at random to instances in the pool.
Weighted: Requests are forwarded to instances in the pool according to a specific percentage.
Round robin: Requests are forwarded to each instance in sequence.
