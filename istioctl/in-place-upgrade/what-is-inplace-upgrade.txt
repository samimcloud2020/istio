pod  with envoy proxy (v17)-------point to --------istiod(v17)

during upgrade
new istiod(v18) created.


and now pod with envoy proxy (v17) point to istiod(v17) and istiod(v18).

pod  with envoy proxy (v17)-------point to --------istiod(v17)
                                           --------istiod(v18)

next istiod(v17) removed.

but still pod with envoy proxy(v17) persist.

so need to restart deployment and pod to make v18.
