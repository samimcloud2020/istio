A multi-cluster deployment (two or more clusters) gives us a greater degree of isolation and availability,
but the cost we pay is in increased complexity. 

If the scenarios call for high availability (HA), we will have to deploy clusters across multiple zones and regions.

The next decision we need to make is to decide if we want to run the clusters 
within one network or if we want to use multiple networks.

-----------------------------Network deployment models-----------------------------------------------------------------
When there are multiple networks involved, the workloads running inside the clusters have to use Istio gateways 
to reach workloads in other clusters.

The use of multiple networks allows for better fault tolerance and scaling of network addresses.

-----------Control plane deployment models--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Istio service mesh uses the control plane to configure all communications between workloads inside the mesh.
The control plane the workloads connect to depends on their configuration.

In the simplest case, we have a service mesh with a single control plane in a single cluster.
This is the configuration we’ve been using throughout this course.

The shared control plane model involves multiple clusters where the control plane is running in one cluster only.
That cluster is referred to as a primary cluster, while other clusters in the deployment are called remote clusters. 
These clusters don’t have their own control plane, instead, they are sharing the control plane from the primary cluster.

-------------------------another deployment model-------------------------------------------------------------------
Another deployment model is where we treat all clusters as remote clusters that are controlled by an external control plane. 
This gives us a complete separation between the control plane and the data plane. 
A typical example of an external control plane is when a cloud vendor is managing it.

For high availability, we should deploy multiple control plane instances across multiple clusters, zones, or regions .
