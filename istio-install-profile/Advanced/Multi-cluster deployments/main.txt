A multi-cluster deployment (two or more clusters) gives us a greater degree of isolation and availability,
but the cost we pay is in increased complexity. 

If the scenarios call for high availability (HA), we will have to deploy clusters across multiple zones and regions.

The next decision we need to make is to decide if we want to run the clusters 
within one network or if we want to use multiple networks.

When there are multiple networks involved, the workloads running inside the clusters have to use Istio gateways 
to reach workloads in other clusters.

The use of multiple networks allows for better fault tolerance and scaling of network addresses.
