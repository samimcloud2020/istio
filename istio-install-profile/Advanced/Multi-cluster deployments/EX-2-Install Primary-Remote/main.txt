-----------------Install Primary-Remote------------------------------------------------------------------
install the Istio control plane on cluster1 (the primary cluster) and configure cluster2 (the remote cluster) 
to use the control plane in cluster1. 

Both clusters reside on the network1 network, meaning there is direct connectivity between the pods in both clusters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this configuration, cluster cluster1 will observe the API Servers in both clusters for endpoints.

In this way, the control plane will be able to provide service discovery for workloads in both clusters.

Service workloads communicate directly (pod-to-pod) across cluster boundaries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Services in cluster2 will reach the control plane in cluster1 via a dedicated gateway for east-west traffic.
