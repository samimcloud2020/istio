Concurrency and rate limiting


concurrency and rate limiting are related, but different concepts; two sides of the same coin.
When thinking of limiting load in systems, operators traditionally think in terms of requests per second. 
The act of limiting the rate of requests sent to a system is rate limiting. Stress tests are normally done to determine
the request rate at which point the service will become overloaded, and then limits are set somewhere below this point. 
In some cases, business logic dictates the rate limit.

On the other side of the coin we have concurrency, that is how many units are in-use simultaneously. 
These units can be requests, connections, etc. For example, instead of thinking in terms of request rate, 
we can think about the number of concurrent in-flight request at a point in time. When we think about concurrent requests,
we can apply queueing theory to determine the number of concurrent requests a service can handle before a queue starts
to build, requests latencies increase, and the service fails due to resource exhaustion.
