To help us with service resiliency, we can use the fault injection feature. 

We can apply the fault injection policies on HTTP traffic and specify one or more faults to inject when forwarding the destination’s request.

There are two types of fault injection. We can delay the requests before forwarding and emulate slow network or overloaded service,
and we can abort the HTTP request and return a specific HTTP error code to the caller. With the abort, we can simulate a faulty upstream service.

Here’s an example of aborting HTTP requests and returning HTTP 404, for 30% of the incoming requests:
