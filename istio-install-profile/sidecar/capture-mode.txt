CaptureMode describes how traffic to a listener is expected to be captured. Applicable only when the listener is bound to an IP.

DEFAULT	
The default capture mode defined by the environment.

IPTABLES	
Capture traffic using IPtables redirection.

NONE	
No traffic capture. When used in an egress listener, the application is expected to explicitly communicate with the listener port 
or Unix domain socket. When used in an ingress listener, care needs to be taken to ensure that the listener port is not in use by 
other processes on the host.
