which namespace to watch and send configuration updates for.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the Istio control plane watches and processes updates for all Kubernetes resources in a cluster. 

All Envoy proxies in the mesh are configured so that they can reach every workload in the mesh and 
accept traffic on all ports associated with the workloads.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, we have deployed two workloads in separate namespaces â€” foo and bar.
Even though we know that foo will never have to talk to bar and the other way around, the endpoints of one service 
will be included in the list of discovered endpoints of the other service.
